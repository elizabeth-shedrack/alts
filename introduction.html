        My name is Elizabeth Faith Shedrack. Im 21 years old,Capricorn, a Nigerian from Southern part of the country. The reason i considered 
        joining AltSchool was so i could pursue a better career for myself. Living in a place like Nigeria, where there arent so many job opportunites, its best to 
        get other alternatives. Altschool will help me in achieveing my goals, unleashing my potential as an individual and earn a better living. Afterall, everyone wants a good life*winks*.
